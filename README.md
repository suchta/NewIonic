NewIonic
========

Welcome to the new development project for JPMC! 

Yay! We're going to write code using the Ionic Framework.

Ionic is a conduit that allows the application of AngularJS to the Cordova Framework, allowing cross-platform development for Androind, iOS, WindowsPhone, and the Web.

Please visit the repository's Wiki page for more information. 

This project will be made private on November 2, 2014
